# iOS Resource extension

This package captures a number of key data points of an iOS application and generates a Resource object that can be passed to a `TracerProvider`


## Usage 

Use `DefaultResource.get()` to generate an all-in-one resource object.


## Caveat 

This package is will only work with projects that have `UIKit` available.
